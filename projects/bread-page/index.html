                <h1>The Daily Loaf</h1> opened in 2022 when former food journalist Sarah Rae traded her press pass for a
                baker's
                apron.
                After years of covering restaurant openings and food trends for the Baltimore Sun, Sarah realized her
                true passion
                was
                creating the stories herself—one loaf at a time.</p>

        <p>Located just off the Thames Street in Fell's Point, The Daily Loaf brings together Sarah's two loves:
            storytelling
            and sourdough. Every morning, we "publish" fresh batches of artisan breads and pastries using traditional
            techniques
            and local ingredients. Just like a great news story, our baking is honest, crafted with care, and meant to
            be
            shared.</p>
        <p>Whether you're a student pulling an all-nighter or a professional preparing for morning calls, The Daily Loaf
            is
            your
            daily source for fresh-baked goodness.</p>

                <p>Our flagship artisan sourdough with a crispy crust and tangy center. Made with our 4-year-old starter
                    and
                    baked fresh every morning. This one's always the front-page story.</p>

                <p>Buttery, gooey cinnamon rolls with cream cheese frosting. So good, they make the headlines every
